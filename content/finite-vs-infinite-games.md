Life is a game, and how we choose to interpret it defines pretty much everything. The game of life can be interpreted as finite or infinite.  
**Finite games** are those that have fixed rules, boundaries, and time constraints where once the whistle blows, the game is over. You either win or lose. The attempt to win a finite game is to fixate on the end result.  

**Infinite games** are those that don’t have fixed rules, boundaries are only imagined, and there are no time constraints (except the eternal truth which is death). There is no predefined concept of winning or losing in infinite games, so you play to learn, grow, and experience. You define success and failure, and if observed carefully, you never fail.  

All meaningful things in life are infinite games where there is no end goal/state that you will ever achieve. The goalpost is always moving, and striving for the goal is what adds meaning.  
*You don’t want to get healthy, you want to stay healthy and fit  
You don’t want to become a good person, you want to be a good person.*  

Infinite games are tied to a person’s identity.  
As James Clear has clearly (*xD*) explained in his book *Atomic Habits*:  
> “Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).”

Playing the infinite game is the reason why Warren Buffet is still working even though he has billions of dollars. It’s not the numbers in the financial reports that add meaning to his life but the process of investing smartly. This is what adds meaning to his life more than anything. That’s the same relationship between Ronaldo and football. This is deeply embedded in their identities that make them enjoy playing the game more than the outcome.  

It can be argued that infinite games are made up of a number of finite games, and it is true for a lot of cases. But how we interpret the motivation to play is what makes the difference. Finite games are played to win, to prove something, and to compete. Infinite games are played to keep playing, to explore, and to create. They are not mutually exclusive, but they require a different mindset and attitude.
